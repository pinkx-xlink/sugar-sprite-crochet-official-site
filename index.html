        </p>

        <h2>Why did we create Sugar Sprite Crochet?</h2>
        <p>
            I've always been passionate about creating and DIY-ing
            everything from my clothes to my decorations.
            My grandma taught me how to sew when I was nine years old
            after she found me trying to create my own plushie by tying 
            pieces of scrap fabric together with yarn. Soon after,
            she granted me the gift of crochet! It was love at first 
            stich.
        </p>
        <p>In elementary school, I began to sell handmade "yarn dolls"
            for a whopping 25 cents each; in middle school, I shipped
            out my first custom handsewn dragon plushie. In high school, 
            I branched out into knitting; I was overjealous at the
            beginning, so I figured I'd sell a few of the many hats 
            I'd whipped up after school. 
        </p>
        <p>At age 16, I made my first crochet crop top, and received 
            requests from my classmates to make some for them, too!
        </p>
        <p>At 21, I had a vision of doing what I want for a living; 
            at 23, I built my business: Sugar Sprite Crochet. 
        </p>
        <p>Now I'm 24. I've made my first few dozen sales, and I'm 
            so excited to see what happens next!
        </p>
